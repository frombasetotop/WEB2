                    <h2>5 Thomas Partey <img src="/css/Partey_Profile_1100x693_0.jpg"></h2>
                    A powerful, skilful central midfielder, Thomas gave a number of stand-out performances during his debut season.
        
        Soon after arriving from Atletico Madrid just before the transfer deadline, the Ghanaian was making his mark in the Premier League – being named Man of the Match in the 1-0 win at Old Trafford.
        
        A combative ball-winner with the ability to dominate games, Thomas lifted the Europa League and European Super Cup, and also played in the 2016 Champions League final for his previous club. During five stellar seasons in the Spanish capital, he earned a reputation as one of the league’s outstanding players.
        
        Named Ghana’s Player of the Year in both 2018 and 2019, he is a mainstay of the national side, and has twice featured at the Africa Cup of Nations.

                    <h2>8 Martin Odegaard <img src="/css/Odegaard_Profile_1100x693_0.jpg"></h2>
                    Having enjoyed a highly-productive loan spell with us in the second half of last season, Martin made his switch from Real Madrid permanent in the summer.
        
        A highly creative, technical attacking midfielder, Martin is most comfortable in the No. 10 role but can also play in deeper central midfield or out wide. Something of a child prodigy, the Norway international made his senior debut for Stromgodset aged 15, then signed for Madrid shortly afterwards and became their youngest-ever player, making his debut aged 16 years and 157 days.
        
        He enjoyed three successful loan spells in Holland and Spain before playing for the Gunners last season, and scoring in the north London derby victory at the Emirates in March. He has been a full international since August 2014, when he became his country’s youngest-ever player, aged 15 years and 253 days. ​​​​​​
                    
                    <h2>34 Granit Xhaka <img src="/css/Xhaka_Profile_1100x693_0.jpg"></h2>
                    Combative midfielder Granit remains a cornerstone of the Arsenal midfield after another productive season in 2020/21 during which he featured 45 times. 
        
        The Switzerland international began his career at Basel, where he won two league titles and the Swiss Cup before joining Borussia Monchengladbach and making 140 appearances across four years for the Bundesliga side.
        
        Since joining the Gunners in 2016 he has lifted four more trophies, winning both the FA Cup and Community Shield twice. The midfielder, who is tough in the tackle and boasts a fearsome long-range shot, has represented his country at two World Cups and two European Championships, most recently at Euro 2020, where he was outstanding in the quarter-final win over France on penalties.
        
        Granit signed a contract extension at the start of the season. 
        
                    <h2>21 Fabio Vieira</h2>
                    
        Attacking midfielder Fabio joined during the summer just after helping Porto with the Portuguese championship.
        
        The left-footed creative midfielder racked up 14 assists and six goals from just 27 league appearances, as he continued his rapid development.
        
        A major part of the Portugal Under-21 squad, he helped them reach the final of the Under-21 European Championships in 2021, and was named Player of the Tournament.
        
        A Porto player from the age of eight, he won the UEFA Youth League in 2019, and progressed to make his first-team debut a year later.
        
        He soon became a regular in the Porto team, and scored in the Champions League group stage in 2020/21. He was named Primeria Liga Player of the Month for April 2022.
        
                    <h2>25 Mohamed Elneny</h2>
                    It was another impressive season for Mo, during which the Egypt international passed the 100-appearance mark for the club.
        
        He impressed with his usual industry and intelligence in central midfield, while also chipping in with some spectacular goals. In December he blasted home from long-range in the Europa League group stage win at Dundalk – a strike later voted Arsenal.com Goal of the Season.
        
        Mo also netted against Olympiacos before registering his first Premier League goal, away to Newcastle United in May.
        
        Now into his seventh season with the Gunners, he joined from Basel, where he won four consecutive Swiss league titles. A full international since 2011, he scored in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations final, but Egypt lost 2-1 to Cameroon. 
        
                    <h2>20 Jorginho</h2>
                    In addition to making nearly 500 club appearances during his career, he has been a regular in the Italy national team squad for more than five years, making 46 appearances and winning Euro 2020 with his country.
        
        Brazilian-born, Jorginho started his career in the youth academy at Italian club Verona with his senior debut coming on loan at Serie C2 side Sambonifacese in 2010/11. After breaking through at Verona he spent four seasons in the first-team, helping them to promotion to Serie A and making 96 appearances before moving to Napoli.
        
        During his time in Naples, he won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana in 2014 and made 160 appearances during his four seasons with the club, and was rewarded with a first Italian cap, whom he qualifies for through his paternal great-grandfather, against Spain in March 2016. 
        
        After following Napoli boss Maurizio Sarri to Chelsea in 2018, Jorginho was a fixture in their side and won the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup during his time at Stamford Bridge.
        
        Following a dream season in 2020/21 that culminated in European Championship glory for the Azzuri, he was named in the Champions League Squad of the Season, the European Championship Team of the Tournament and crowned UEFA Men’s Player of the Year for 2020/21, as well as a third-place finish in the Ballon d'Or voting.

        A product of the Hale End academy, Emile joined Arsenal when he was 10 and played ahead of his age group as he progressed through the system. He made his first-team debut early in 2018/19, aged 18, and netted his first goal just two weeks later.
        
        After successful loan spells with Red Bull Leipzig in the Bundesliga in 2018/19 and Huddersfield Town in the Championship in 2019/20, he returned to the side last season, mainly operating in the No. 10 role.
        
        His first Premier League goal came at home to West Brom in May, and a few days later he struck the winner away to Chelsea. He also made his England Under-21 debut last season, having been part of the Under-17 World Cup winning side in 2017.
        
        Shortly before the start of this season Emile signed a new long-term contract, and was given the No. 10 shirt .
