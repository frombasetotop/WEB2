                    </h2>
                    Talented young goalkeeper Aaron joined in the summer, having been part of the England squad that reached the final of Euro 2020. Very highly regarded throughout the early part of his career, Aaron made the switch from Sheffield United – the club at which he started his pro career – making his debut aged 18 in 2016.

        He joined Bournemouth in 2017, and enjoyed loan spells at Chesterfield and AFC Wimbledon – winning Young Player of the Year award at the latter, and helping them survive relegation from League One.

        He returned to Bournemouth, winning the supporters’ Player of the Year award in 2019/20, before rejoining Sheffield United at the start of 2020/21. That season he was named United’s Player and Young Player of the Year.

        A regular for England at youth levels from under-18 to under-21, the right-footed stopper won the UEFA U19 Championships in 2017, keeping three clean sheets in his five appearances, then played 15 times for the Under-21s.

                30 MATT Turner 
            </h2>
            USA international goalkeeper Matt joined in the summer, having played all his football in America until that point.

A regular for New England Revolution from 2018, he had previously been loaned to Richmond Kickers after joining from Jersey Express.

His form in MLS soon led to a call up to the United States national team, and he saved a penalty on his debut against Trinidad and Tobago in January 2021.

Later that year he played every game as USA won the CONCACAF Gold Cup, keeping five clean sheets in the tournament, earning the Golden Glove award. He was also named MLS Goalkeeper of the Year in 2021, and he saved two penalties in the MLS All-Star Game later that year.

An Arsenal fan since his childhood, he has dual American-Lithuanian nationality due to his parents.

                31 Karl Hein
            </h2>
            A commanding presence between the posts with impressive distribution skills, Karl is already a regular for Estonia at senior international level, having made his senior international debut in August 2020.

Karl joined us from Nomme United in his hometown, where he represented the first team aged 16. Named Estonian Young Player of the Year in 2021, he was on the bench for our Premier League opener against Brentford last season, before joining up with Championship side Reading on loan for the second half of the campaign.
