                    <h2>
                        7 Bukayo Saka <img src="/css/Saka_Profile_1100x693_0.jpg">
                    </h2>
                    Arsenal’s Player of the Season for 2020/21, Bukayo continued to make great strides forward last term, confirming his status as one of the hottest young prospects in European football.

        He notched seven goals in all competitions, and the same number of assists – no player had more for us last season. A hugely versatile player, Bukayo can play at full back but is usually deployed as a wide forward, using his pace and trickery to devastating effect.

        A product of our Hale End Academy, Bukayo has been with the club from the age of eight and made his first-team debut shortly after his 17th birthday, in 2018. He was called up to the England squad for Euro 2020, netting his first international goal in a friendly against Austria in June.

        He was one of the star performers for England at the tournament, winning man-of-the-match against the Czech Republic in the group stage, then becoming the youngest player ever to appear for England in a major final .

            <h2>
                9 Gabriel Jesus <img src="/css/Jesus_Profile_1100x693_0.jpg">
            </h2>
            A dynamic forward with a wealth of Premier League experience, Gabriel joined in the summer to reunite with Mikel Arteta, who had coached him at previous club Manchester City.

The striker, who can also play in a deeper role or on the flank, won four Premier League titles during a glittering five-and-a-half-year career with City, as well as one FA Cup, three League Cups and he played in the 2020/21 Champions League final.

In total he scored 95 goals for the club, but was also known for his creativity – he led the way for Premier League assists for them last term with eight, to go with his eight goals in the league.

A teenage sensation at first club Palmeiras, he made his first-team debut as a 17 year old and was soon earning international recognition.

He helped Brazil Under-20s reach the final of the 2015 U20 World Cup, and the following year he won gold with the under-23s at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.

Later in 2016 he made his debut for the senior Brazil team, then featured at the 2018 World Cup. He passed the 50 cap mark in 2021. 

            <h2>
                11 Gabriel Martinelli <img src="/css/Martinelli_Profile_1100x693_0.jpg">
            </h2>
            One of the most exciting players of his generation, Gabriel once again highlighted his vast potential last season. An electric forward – whether operating as a striker or wide on the left – the Brazilian returned from a knee injury in December and picked up where he left off.

            An excellent finisher with an indefatigable work ethic, ‘Gabi’ (full name Gabriel Teodoro Martinelli Silva) scored in our Premier League wins at Sheffield United and Crystal Palace.
            
            This is his third season at the club, after bursting on to the scene in 2019/20 following his arrival from Brazilian side Ituano. A Brazil youth international capped at under-23 level, the highlight of his debut season in England was a magnificent solo goal in a 2-2 Premier League draw away to Chelsea, winning the Arsenal.com Goal of the Season award.
            
            In the summer he was part of the Brazil squad that claimed gold at the Tokyo Olympics.
            <h2>
                14 Eddie Nketiah
            </h2>
            Once again, Eddie weighed in with a number of valuable goals last season, demonstrating his striker’s instincts in both the Premier League and Europa League.

He scored a crucial late winner at home to West Ham in September, and an even later equaliser against Fulham in April, as well as three goals in Europe.

In October 2020 he broke the all-time goalscoring record for England Under-21s, netting his 14th goal at that level, then captained the side at the 2021 European U21 Championships.

An Arsenal player from the age of 16, he scored 24 goals in each of his first two seasons in the Gunners youth setup, then burst onto the first-team scene as an 18 year old, with a late brace at home to Norwich in the Carabao Cup in 2017. Fast, hard-working with fantastic movement, Eddie is also eligible to play for Ghana. 

            <h2>
                24 Reiss Nelson
            </h2>
            An Arsenal player from the age of nine, Reiss appeared in all five competitions last season, scoring his first European goal in the process.

A tricky, skilful winger, the England under-21 international started the season by lifting the Community Shield at Wembley, and netted in the 3-0 Europa League win away to Molde in November. He was just 17 when he made his debut in 2016, having steadily risen through the youth setup.

He enjoyed a productive loan spell in the Bundesliga with Hoffenheim in 2018/19, where he netted seven times, and this season is on loan to Feyenoord.
            <h2>
                19 Leandro Trossard
            </h2>
            The Belgium international joined us from Brighton & Hove Albion in January 2023, having been a member of the Belgium squad at the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.

Leandro started his career in the youth academy at Genk in 2010, before quickly developing into the first-team squad. During his time with Genk, where he made 120 appearances, Leandro enjoyed successful loan spells with Lommel United, Westerlo and OH Leuven in the early development stages of his career, and ended his time at the club by captaining them to their first league title in eight years.

That prompted Brighton to snap him up for a reported £18 million in the summer of 2019, and he quickly made an impression as he scored on his debut against West Ham United. That would be the first of five goals that term to help Brighton avoid relegation, and the same number would follow the next campaign as he adapted well to life in England.

The goals kept coming over the next two seasons, including one at our expense back in April 2022 when he opened the scoring in Brighton’s 2-1 win at Emirates Stadium. His Premier League performances finally led him to making his first appearance for his national side in September 2020 in a UEFA Nations League game against Denmark.

He would win six caps before netting his first international goals against Belarus and earning himself a spot in Roberto Martinez’s Euro 2020 squad, where he made one appearance in a group stage win against Finland.
